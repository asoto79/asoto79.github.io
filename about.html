                        My name is Antonio (Tony) Soto. I am junior studying Cybersecurity at Purdue University Northwest. I am looking to break into the industry as a SOC or digital forensic analyst.
                        My passion for cyber defense stems from my past as a soccer player where I played as a defender and my love for technology.
                        In my time outside of school I serve as an officer for ROARCyber, PNW's cybersecurity club, and as an assistant coach for boy's high school soccer.
                        My experiences have given my a plethora of important skills such as leadership, teamwork, analysis, and many others.
